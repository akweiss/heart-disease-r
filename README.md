# Heart Disease EDA in R

A project demonstrating some concepts of EDA in R using primarily dplyr and ggplot2. The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) for this project was found on Kaggle; the goal was to perform some exploratory data analysis to understand and interpret facets of heart disease from the dataset. All work for this project is located in the EDA file [here](https://github.com/akweiss/heart-disease-r/blob/master/eda).
